With wavelyric, you can create Karaoke-style timing data for every word in any song. You'll have a waveform representation of the song and a bunch of keyboard shortcuts at your fingertips to help you get going.

When you're finished, you can export to a .lrc file, formatted perfectly for use with [Steno Hero](http://store.steampowered.com/app/449000/), a free typing game aimed at stenographers.

You can also export .ogg files with [ogg-vorbis-encoder-js](https://github.com/higuma/ogg-vorbis-encoder-js).
